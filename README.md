# Face-mask-classification-with-tensorflow

This project aims to detect whether or not a person is waering a face mask.

The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm 
[Convolutional Neural Networks] is used for the classification of the images.

## Conceptual Framework:
The project is entirely implemented using Python3. 

The Conceptual Framework involved is mainly:
Keras â€“ Tensorflow backend
